        # Seek the optimized uplink power. This is the default case unless
        # is_power_optimized is explicitly assigned false.
        # Ex. the IPSTAR return channel normally calculates with full BUC power
        # so no power optimization required.

        # ---- C/N Uplink ----

        # For forward or broadcast channel, check whether the uplink station is specified.
        # If not, use the default gateway of the channel
        # If uplink station is specified, check the following for usage compatibility:
        # 1. Antenna's transmit frequency range and polarization matches the beam
        # 2. Uplink location is in the beam coverage
        # Return error if requirements are not met

        # Compute C/N Uplink (clear sky and rain fade)

        # ---- C/N Downlink ----

        # Compute EIRP downlink of the channel from uplink power flux density and satellite settings

        # For return channel, check whether the downlink station is specified.
        # If not, use the default gateway of the channel
        # If downlink station is specified, check the following for usage compatibility:
        # 1. Antenna's receive frequency range and polarization matches the beam
        # 2. Downlink location is in the beam coverage
        # Return error if requirements are not met

        # Compute C/N Downlink (clear sky, up fade only, down fade only and both fade from default availability)

        # ---- C/I ----

        # Compute the value of C/I from power source if it has default value of C/I3IM or NPR in the database.

        # Compute C/I from satellite if it has default value of transponder's C/I3M or NPR

        # Compute C/I uplink from adjacent satellites

        # Compute C/I downlink from adjacent satellites

        # Compute C/I uplink from adjacent cells

        # Compute C/I downlink from adjacent cells

        # ---- C/N Total ----

        # Compute C/N Total (clear sky, up fade only, down fade only and both fade )

        # ---- Capacity ----
        # Compute link capacity (clear sky, up fade only, down fade only and both fade )
        # in both MHz and Mbps

        # Pick the MCG at both fade and calculate capacity. If the modem has no ACM function, let capacity
        # at clear sky equals to capacity at both fade

        # Else, pick MCG at clear sky and calculate capacity separately for clear sky condition.

        # Seek the maximum total link availability if needed.

        # Record all parameters into the result object
